  abstract = {In this paper a building occupancy prediction method is presented, which is based on the spatio-temporal analysis of historical data (occupancy modelling) and further relies heavily on current contextual information, being therefore suitable for providing real-time prediction. Two different algorithmic approaches are proposed, based on Markov models, revealing how context awareness adds the capability of rapidly adjusting to current conditions and capturing unexpected events, as opposed to capturing only typical occupancy fluctuation expected on a regular basis. Both proposed approaches are evaluated against accurate real-life data collected from a tertiary building, achieving notable results which outperform currently used methods.},

  abstract = {Although it is widely acknowledged that occupants play a critical role in building energy consumption, the characteristics of occupants are not well-represented in building simulation. Many statistic and data-mining technologies have been applied to develop a reliable occupant model. In contrast, rather than attempting to develop the occupant model, this study aims to investigate the correlation between the occupant behavior and energy consumption based on a series of experiments. First, this paper discusses the randomness of the occupants’ presence and behavior. The degree of randomness was verified using a Normalized Cumulative Periodogram (NCP) based on a random walk hypothesis. In addition, the correlation between occupant and energy consumption was investigated using the wavelet coherence. This study shows that, while the occupants’ presence has a randomness, it is not strongly correlated to the energy consumption. The occupants’ active action to control a heating/cooling system (turn on/off) is correlated to the energy consumption. In contrast to the occupant's presence, the occupants’ active action does not follow the random walk, and it has no particular frequency. This means that it is difficult to predict the control action of occupants with a specific time interval.},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency (EE) and demand response (DR) programs are designed to reduce energy consumption, mitigate grid capacity constraints, support intermittent renewable energy integration, and reduce pollution for less than the cost of additional generation. However, the savings and flexibility achieved by EE and DR programs are contingent on programs finding and enrolling customers well matched to program objectives. Many EE programs currently rely on broad but shallow savings from prescriptive measures, but growing in- terest in deeper and more reliable savings is leading to increased attention for program planning and targeting using empirical criteria. Through data gathered by smart meters and software designed to manage and analyze large data sets, the tools required to cost effectively characterize, target, and change patterns of energy demand are beginning to emerge. This dissertation consists of three chapters on the analysis of meter data and one on the policy implications of these new capabilities. Chapter 2 analyzes hourly electricity and daily natural gas smart meter readings from 30,000 residential customers of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E). Meter data is used to derive distributions of previously unobserved characteristics of the housing stock. We show that the targeting of EE and DR programs would be improved through selection of households based on their positions within these distributions. It follows that every utility (or public utility commission) with sufficient metering infrastructure could ap- ply similar techniques to improve the targeting, implementation, and evaluation of their energy efficiency and demand response programs. Chapter 3 uses regression models of patterns in daily household electricity consumption to estimate the physical and operational characteristics of homes. We apply semi-physical regressors designed to capture patterns in the space-heating and cooling, scheduling, and occupancy of homes. When applied to data from approximately 160,000 PG\&E customers, this approach supports an evaluation of competing regression model formulations and provides distributions of model coefficients used to evaluate patterns of domestic energy use, including annual and system peak coincident air conditioning loads, cooling set points, day of week scheduling, and lighting energy.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for automated fault detection tools in buildings. The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach.},

  abstract = {Campus energy management increasingly demands a controlled and managed process for achieving the aims of cost control and operation effectiveness. A mature decision making process is driven by data gathering, analysis and reporting, as advocated by business intelligence (BI), which already has had broad impact on enterprises. The BI process has been widely adopted by universities in a number of areas already, including student services (enrollment) but less so in supporting areas like energy management. This paper describes an initial effort to apply BI practices to manage energy (starting with electric power) consumption on campuses, beginning with a needs assessment to develop an effective energy usage data gathering (in real-time), modeling, analysis and reporting process on our own campus. We provide details on how the situation was at the beginning of our four-month project, and on the improvements we were able to make to the campus' energy management process.},

  abstract = {Building occupancy is a paramount factor in building energy simulations. Specifically, lighting, plug loads, HVAC equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10 min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules. The identified occupancy rules and schedules are representative as four archetypal working profiles that can be used as input to current building energy modeling programs, such as EnergyPlus or IDA-ICE, to investigate impact of occupant presence on design, operation and energy use in office buildings.},

  abstract = {While rule based control (RBC) is current practice in most building automation systems that issue discrete control signals, recent simulation studies suggest that advanced, optimization based control methods such as hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) can potentially outperform RBC in terms of energy efficiency and occupancy comfort. However, HMPC requires a more complex IT infrastructure and numerical optimization in the loop, which makes commissioning, operation of the building, and error handling significantly more involved than in the rule based setting. In this paper, we suggest an automated RBC synthesis procedure for binary decisions that extracts prevalent information from simulation data with HMPC controllers. The result is a set of simple decision rules that preserves much of the control performance of HMPC. The methods are based on standard machine learning algorithms, in particular support vector machines (SVMs) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). We consider also the ranking and selection of measurements which are used for a decision and show that this feature selection is useful in both complexity reduction and reduction of investment costs by pruning unnecessary sensors. The suggested methods are evaluated in simulation for six different case studies and shown to maintain the performance of HMPC despite a tremendous reduction in complexity.},

  doi = {10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280473},
  abstract = {In this paper, a novelty detection algorithm for the identification of leakages in smart water/gas grid contexts is proposed. It is based on two separate stages: the first deals with the creation of the statistical leakage-free model, whereas the second evaluates the eventual occurrence of leakage on the basis of the model likelihood. Up to the authors' knowledge, this approach has never been used in the application scenario of interest. A set of several features are extracted from the Almanac of Minutely Power Dataset, and a suboptimal selection is executed to determinate the best combination. The abnormal event (leakage) is induced by manipulating the consumption in the test set. A total of 10 background models are created, by employing both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) under a comparative perspective, and each of them is adopted to detect 10 leakages, with random duration, length and starting time. Finally, the performance are evaluated in terms of Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). Obtained results are more than encouraging: the best average AUCs of 85.60\% and 87.97\% are achieved with HMM, at 1 minute resolution, for natural gas and water, respectively. Specifically, considering true detection rates (TDRs) of 100\%, the natural gas exhibits an overall false detection rate (FDR) of 17.11\%, and the water achieves an overall FDR of 13.79\%.},

  abstract = {With the advances of information technologies, today's Building Automation Systems (BASs) are capable of managing building operational performance in an efficient and convenient way. Meanwhile, the amount of real-time monitoring and control data in BASs grows continually in the building lifecycle, which stimulates an intense demand for powerful big data analysis tools in BASs. Existing big data analytics adopted in the building automation industry focus on mining cross-sectional relationships, whereas the temporal relationships, i.e., the relationships over time, are usually overlooked. However, building operations are typically dynamic and BAS data are essentially multivariate time series data. This paper presents a time series data mining methodology for temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data. A number of time series data mining techniques are explored and carefully assembled, including the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif discovery, and temporal association rule mining. This study also develops two methods for the efficient post-processing of knowledge discovered. The methodology has been applied to analyze the BAS data retrieved from a real building. The temporal knowledge discovered is valuable to identify dynamics, patterns and anomalies in building operations, derive temporal association rules within and between subsystems, assess building system performance and spot opportunities in energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Building Automation System (BAS) plays an important role in building operation nowadays. A huge amount of building operational data is stored in BAS; however, the data can seldom be effectively utilized due to the lack of powerful tools for analyzing the large data. Data mining (DM) is a promising technology for discovering knowledge hidden in large data. This paper presents a generic framework for knowledge discovery in massive BAS data using DM techniques. The framework is specifically designed considering the low quality and complexity of BAS data, the diversity of advanced DM techniques, as well as the integration of knowledge discovered by DM techniques and domain knowledge in the building field. The framework mainly consists of four phases, i.e., data exploration, data partitioning, knowledge discovery, and post-mining. The framework is applied to analyze the BAS data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is adopted to identify the most significant time variables to the aggregated power consumption. Then the clustering analysis is used to identify the typical operation patterns in terms of power consumption. Eight operation patterns have been identified and therefore the entire BAS data are partitioned into eight subsets. The quantitative association rule mining (QARM) method is adopted for knowledge discovery in each subset considering most of BAS data are numeric type. To enhance the efficiency of the post-mining phase, two indices are proposed for fast and conveniently identifying and utilizing potentially interesting rules discovered by QARM. The knowledge discovered is successfully used for understanding the building operating behaviors, identifying non-typical operating conditions and detecting faulty conditions.},

Example applications include building energy management and HVAC unit diagnostics. We present methods employed in our Wakame visualization system to support such tasks as discovering anomalies and comparing performance across multiple time series. Novel methods include animated transitions that relate data in spatially located 3D views with conventional 2D graphs. Additionally, several components of our prototype employ analytics to guide the user to interesting portions of the dataset.},

With the advance of technology hardware and software for buildings, there is an increasing amount of available data to inform building operations, maintenance and management. However, facility management personnel have limited time and resources and need concise metrics, visualizations, and information in order to support their daily operations and decision-making. Recent works, such as ASHRAE’s Performance Measurement Protocols in Commercial Buildings, have focused attention on the metrics relevant to tracking building performance. The research described in this report seeks to expand such investigations to consider visualization of operational metrics focused on an audience including facility managers, control technicians, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technicians, facilities service providers, and commissioning engineers.},

  abstract = {Trustworthy savings calculations are critical to convincing investors in energy efficiency projects of the benefit and cost-effectiveness of such investments and their ability to replace or defer supply-side capital investments. However, today’s methods for measurement and verification (M\&amp;V) of energy savings constitute a significant portion of the total costs of efficiency projects. They also require time-consuming manual data acquisition and often do not deliver results until years after the program period has ended. The rising availability of “smart” meters, combined with new analytical approaches to quantifying savings, has opened the door to conducting M\&amp;V more quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy. These meter- and software-based approaches, increasingly referred to as “M\&amp;V 2.0”, are the subject of surging industry interest, particularly in the context of utility energy efficiency programs. Program administrators, evaluators, and regulators are asking how M\&amp;V 2.0 compares with more traditional methods, how proprietary software can be transparently performance tested, how these techniques can be integrated into the next generation of whole-building focused efficiency programs. This paper expands recent analyses of public-domain whole-building M\&amp;V methods, focusing on more novel M\&amp;V 2.0 modeling approaches that are used in commercial technologies, as well as approaches that are documented in the literature, and/or developed by the academic building research community. We present a testing procedure and metrics to assess the performance of whole-building M\&amp;V methods. We then illustrate the test procedure by evaluating the accuracy of ten baseline energy use models, against measured data from a large dataset of 537 buildings. The results of this study show that the already available advanced interval data baseline models hold great promise for scaling the adoption of building measured savings calculations using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data. Median coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) was less than 25\% for every model tested when twelve months of training data were used. With even six months of training data, median CV(RMSE) for daily energy total was under 25\% for all models tested. These findings can be used to build confidence in model robustness, and the readiness of these approaches for industry uptake and adoption.},

Still, today the experts use visual tools for analyzing the data. In order to make the task realistic, a method has been proposed in this paper to automatically detect the different patterns in buildings. The K Means clustering is used to automatically identify the ON (operational) cycles of the chiller. In the next step the ON cycles are transformed to symbolic representation by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) method. Then the SAX symbols are converted to bag of words representation for hierarchical clustering. Moreover, the proposed technique is applied to real life data of adsorption chiller. Additionally, the results from the proposed method and dynamic time warping (DTW) approach are also discussed and compared.},

  abstract = {The detection of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns in time series, often called motifs, has been recognized as an important task. However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation. We have applied these methods to two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production. The results provide important new insights into the recurring patterns.},

Large data consist of building information, energy consumption, environmental measurements and occupancy information, which are combined and correlated utilizing data analytics techniques, so as to extract useful semantic information about building performance. Also, visual analytics techniques are exploited to visualize them in a compact and comprehensive way taking into account properties of human cognition, perception and sense making. They analyze and visualize the performance of the buildings under comparison in the spatio-temporal domain assisting the analyst to compare them and detect patterns, templates and crucial points that are difficult to be detected otherwise. The performance comparison of different buildings or buildings of different designs or buildings with space usage rearrangement is an important factor in engineering that leads to building renovation and construction with low energy consumption and gas emissions in conjunction with comfort, utility and durability.},

  abstract = {To the extent that demand response represents an intentional electricity usage adjustment to price changes or incentive payments, consumers who exhibit more-variable load patterns on normal days may be capable of altering their loads more significantly in response to dynamic pricing plans. This study investigates the variation in the pre-enrollment load patterns of Korean commercial and industrial electricity customers and their impact on event-day loads during a critical peak pricing experiment in the winter of 2013. Contrary to conventional approaches to profiling electricity loads, this study proposes a new clustering technique based on variability indices that collectively represent the potential demand–response resource that these customers would supply. Our analysis reveals that variability in pre-enrollment load patterns does indeed have great predictive power for estimating their impact on demand–response loads. Customers in relatively low-variability clusters provided limited or no response, whereas customers in relatively high-variability clusters consistently presented large load impacts, accounting for most of the program-level peak reductions. This study suggests that dynamic pricing programs themselves may not offer adequate motivation for meaningful adjustments in load patterns, particularly for customers in low-variability clusters.},

  abstract = {BESMs (building energy simulation models) play an important role in the design, optimization and retrofit of buildings. Developing a BESM is relatively simple in the building design phase because nearly all inputs are known from design parameters. However, in the building operation phase, developing and calibrating a BESM becomes difficult because all operating parameters must be adjusted according to real-time data. All of these parameters are difficult to measure, and they vary over time. Existing calibration methods of BESMs, which involve hundreds of input parameters, lack standard procedures and require specialized engineers. Engineers must randomly adjust input parameters until the output energy use matches measured energy use. To solve the problem above, a new calibration approach with a detailed procedure is proposed in this paper. This approach relies on electricity submetering data and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) cooling/heating loads. These data are becoming more available in commercial buildings. A case study is demonstrated in a large commercial building with satisfying results. The CV (coefficient of variation) and MBE (mean bias error) of the total hourly electricity consumption simulation, excluding HVAC, are 4\% and 3\%, respectively. The CVs of an HVAC system are 12\% (chiller), 6\% (pump) and 5\% (fan), and the MBEs are 10\% (chiller), 5\% (pump) and 4\% (fan).},

  abstract = {In the past several decades Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) have become vital components of most modern buildings. BEMSs utilize advanced microprocessor technology combined with extensive sensor data collection and communication to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high human comfort levels. When properly tuned and operated, BEMSs can provide significant energy savings. However, the complexity of the acquired sensory data and the overwhelming amount of presented information renders them difficult to adjust or even understand by responsible building managers. This inevitably results in suboptimal BEMS operation and performance. To address this issue, this paper reports on a research effort that utilizes Computational Intelligence techniques to fuse multiple heterogeneous sources of BEMS data and to extract relevant actionable information. This actionable information can then be easily understood and acted upon by responsible building managers. In particular, this paper describes the use of anomaly detection algorithms for improving the understandability of BEMS data and for increasing the state-awareness of building managers. The developed system utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to automatically build a model of normal BEMS operations and detect possible anomalous behavior. In addition, linguistic summaries based on fuzzy set representation of the input values are generated for the detected anomalies which increase the understandability of the presented results.

  abstract = {The amount of sensor data generated by modern building systems is growing rapidly. Automatically discovering the structure of diurnal patterns in this data supports implementation of building commissioning, fault detection and retrofit analysis techniques. Additionally, these data are crucial to informing design professionals about the efficacy of their assumptions and strategies used in performance prediction simulation models. In this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using k-means clustering. This procedure is designed for application on whole building and sub-system metrics from hierarchical building and energy management systems (BMS/EMS). The process transforms quantitative raw data into qualitative subgroups based on daily performance similarity and visualizes them using expressive techniques. We apply DayFilter on 474 days of example data from an international school campus in a tropical climate and 407 days of data from an office building from a temperate European climate. Discords are filtered resulting in 17 and 22 patterns found. Selected discords are investigated and many correlate with specific failures and energy savings detected by the on-site operations staff. Six and ten motif candidates are detected in the two case studies. These motifs are then further aggregated to five and six performance clusters that reflect the typical operational behavior of those projects.

  abstract = {Commissioning is arguably the single most cost-effective strategy for reducing energy, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions in buildings today. Although commissioning has earned increased recognition in recent years, it remains an enigmatic practice whose visibility severely lags its potential. The application of commissioning to new buildings ensures that they deliver or exceed the performance and energy savings promised by their design and intended operation. When applied to existing buildings, commissioning identifies deficiencies and the almost inevitable “drift” from intended performance over time, and carries out interventions to put the building back on course. More formally, commissioning is a systematic, forensic approach to quality assurance and performance risk management, rather than a technology per se. This article presents the world’s largest compilation and meta-analysis of commissioning experience and the associated literature, comprising 643 non-residential buildings, 99 million ft2 of floorspace, \$43 million in commissioning expenditures, and the work of 37 commissioning providers. The median normalized cost to deliver commissioning is \$0.30/ft2 (\$2009 currencies) for existing buildings and \$1.16/ft2 for new construction (or 0.4\% of the overall construction cost). The one third of projects for which data are available reveal over 10,000 energy-related deficiencies, the correction of which resulted in 16\% median whole-building energy savings in existing buildings and 13\% in new construction, with payback times of 1.1 and 4.2 years, respectively. Because energy savings exceed commissioning costs, the associated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions come at a “negative” cost of −\$110/tonne CO2 for new buildings and −\$25/tonne for new construction. Cases with comprehensive commissioning attained nearly twice the overall median level of savings and five times the savings of the least-thorough projects. Significant non-energy benefits such as improved indoor air quality are also achieved. Applying the median whole-building energy-saving values to the US non-residential buildings stock corresponds to an annual energy-saving potential of \$30 billion (and 340 Mt of CO2) by the year 2030.},

With the information and communication technology, the smart meters are devised to gather and communicate the information of electricity suppliers and residential electricity consumers to ameliorate the efficiency of power distribution as well as the sustainability of the power resources. Due to the enormous amount of electricity consumers, the analysis of the big data produced by the smart meters is a crucial challenge faced by the electricity companies and researchers. In this paper, we analyze the big data based on the smart meter readings collected in the Houston area. The statistical properties of the data is investigated such that the behaviors of the consumers can be better understood. Moreover, the kernel PCA analysis and non-parametric clustering of the data gives a comprehensive guidance on what are the potential clusters of the customers and how to allocate the power more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Data centers are a critical component of modern IT infrastructure but are also among the worst environmental offenders through their increasing energy usage and the resulting large carbon footprints. Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a 'first-principles' approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable. Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse don't care transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by HP and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach.},

Energy normalization techniques are applied for the analysis of the data and the hotels are classified using a multivariate analysis. The energy classification of the hotels in Attica in 3 classes is based on clustering techniques using the collected data on the heating, cooling and electricity consumption of the hotels in the sample. A component/factor F1 is identified, which is an index of the hotels energy saving potential in absolute value. The study stresses the importance of this factor F1 as a means to promote sustainability and energy efficiency in the hotel sector and analyzes the best case scenario of each class in an effort to study best practices, set goals and define potentials for energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Identification of electricity use is one of the key elements to motivate customers to promote activities leading more efficient use of energy. Furthermore, electricity use comparisons with other similar customers give more interesting and concrete point of view to examine own consumption habits. In future, electricity providers and retailers are willing and probably forced by legislation to provide such information by the means of energy conservation and efficiency improvement. On the other hand, high number of customers set challenges to handle electricity use data and to create proper comparison information. In this study we present efficient and highly automated way to create comparison groups based on customers building characteristics. The main advantages of the data-based approach are that customer location is noticed, comparison groups are created using concrete building information, data processing is highly automated and also method is computationally efficient. Additionally, presented method provide tool to target and to create customer specific electricity saving guidance. The performance of suggested approach was tested using data set which contained electricity use and building information concerning almost 8000 customers.},

  abstract = {The building stock in the world consumes approximately 40\% of the energy and emits one third of the total greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). Improving the energy efficiency in buildings is vital to address the climate change and achieve energy independence (i.e. to become net-zero energy). Improving energy performance in existing buildings has been receiving significant attention recently, which entails reducing energy demand for building operations, without affecting the health and comfort of its occupants. This approach requires strategies beyond mere technical advancements. However, there is limited published literature which has comprehensively addressed these issues. The aim of this paper is to critically review existing body-of-the-knowledge on improving energy efficiency of operating both commercial and institutional buildings. Peer-reviewed journal articles published from year 2000 to 2014 in reputed journals were reviewed. This review investigated contemporary energy efficiency approaches including technical, organizational, and behavioural changes. Based on the comprehensive literature review, a strategy map was developed as a pathway for achieving better building energy performance. It was noted that even though the existing studies predominately focused on technical advancements, approaches such as building behavioural changes have been largely overlooked. Findings of this study provide an important basis for setting up a national and organization wide strategy for improving the energy efficiency of commercial and institutional buildings.},

  abstract = {Retrofitting the existing building stock is among the most important objectives and imperative to meet societal goals to reduce primary energy demand and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. District heating systems have proven to supply heat for buildings both energy and cost efficiently. Thermal microgrids (TMGs) can be understood as a subcategory of district heating systems: small scale, bidirectional, and potentially fed by different thermal sources. Given a suitable combination of loads, the number of and distance between buildings, they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on georeferenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient TMG. For the identification, both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify nine groups of 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17.4\% cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply. This would save approximately 30\% of the building-induced CO2 emission of the community.},

  abstract = {Utility companies provide electricity to a large number of consumers. These companies need to have an accurate forecast of the next day electricity demand. Any forecast errors will result in either reliability issues or increased costs for the company. Because of the widespread roll-out of smart meters, a large amount of high resolution consumption data is now accessible which was not available in the past. This new data can be used to improve the load forecast and as a result increase the reliability and decrease the expenses of electricity providers. In this paper, a number of methods for improving load forecast using smart meter data are discussed. In these methods, consumers are first divided into a number of clusters. Then a neural network is trained for each cluster and forecasts of these networks are added together in order to form the prediction for the aggregated load. In this paper, it is demonstrated that clustering increases the forecast accuracy significantly. Criteria used for grouping consumers play an important role in this process. In this work, three different feature selection methods for clustering consumers are explained and the effect of feature extraction methods on forecast error is investigated.},

  abstract = {In smart building systems, the automatic control of devices relies on matching the sensed environment information to customized rules. With the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), low-cost and self-organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems, but produce abundant sensing data. Therefore, a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of WSANs based smart building systems. However, traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data, which are not suitable for large scale WSANs based smart building systems. To address these issues, we build an efficient rule engine. Specifically, we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages, and then build a β-network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events. Taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of MPHF, we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with O(1) time overhead. Moreover, a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead. We implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an approach for saving energy in commercial buildings, based on the information gathered from pre-existing opportunistic context sources. Most energy management systems rely on a heavy instrumentation strategy to infer occupancies, and unfortunately ignore already available opportunistic context sources, that can provide significant information about occupancy. We present models to conduct a Context Profiling with available context sources, to infer spatial occupancy measures. Further, we model electrical loads of several types to infer potential energy savings. Through a pilot study of a building with 5 users for 30 days, we identify intra-building areas where additional instrumentation of occupancy sensors is not necessary and demonstrate potential for significant reduction in energy consumption. We believe such Context Profiling can provide insights to significantly reduce deployment and management costs for future occupancy detection and energy management systems},

  abstract = {Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) are essential components of modern buildings that are responsible for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. However, since indoor environment is dependent on many uncertain criteria, performance of BEMS can be suboptimal at times. Unfortunately, complexity of BEMSs, large amount of data, and interrelations between data can make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. This paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Anomaly Detection and Linguistic Description (Fuzzy-ADLD)-based method for improving the understandability of BEMS behavior for improved state-awareness. The presented method is composed of two main parts: 1) detection of anomalous BEMS behavior; and 2) linguistic representation of BEMS behavior. The first part utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to build a model of normal BEMS behavior. The second part of the presented method computes the most relevant linguistic description of the identified anomalies. The presented Fuzzy-ADLD method was applied to real-world BEMS system and compared against a traditional alarm-based BEMS. Six different scenarios were tested, and the presented Fuzzy-ADLD method identified anomalous behavior either as fast as or faster (an hour or more) than the alarm based BEMS. Furthermore, the Fuzzy-ADLD method identified cases that were missed by the alarm-based system, thus demonstrating potential for increased state-awareness of abnormal building behavior.},

In real-world complicated systems, even experts often fail to specify causal factors, thus they attempt to detect the anomaly with exploratory heuristics. Our goal is to offer further information that supports anomaly cause analysis using the incomplete empirical knowledge. Proposed technique discovers responsible factors for the fault by leveraging domain knowledge with an effective combination of semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and boundary-based discriminative subspace identification method. Experimental results on synthetic and real dataset confirmed validity of our approach. Moreover, we applied this method to the building energy fault diagnosis and succeeded in extracting causal variables for energy waste in a building. View full abstract},

  abstract = {A very large number of measurement points are required to calibrate building energy models for the purpose of ongoing commissioning in HVAC systems. Building automation systems (BASs), common in many commercial and institutional buildings, can provide a large fraction of the required data. To reduce the time for BAS trend data analysis and export, a proof-of-concept prototype, called the Automatic Assisted Calibration Tool (AACT) was developed. The tool is a first step toward developing software that can automatically couple trend data for use in ongoing commissioning and calibrating building energy models. The AACT was tested using a case study institutional building, which proved its capacity to extract useful data and calculate indices of energy performance.},
