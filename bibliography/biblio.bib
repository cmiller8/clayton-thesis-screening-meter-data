	abstract = {Retrofitting the existing building stock is among the most important objectives and imperative to meet societal goals to reduce primary energy demand and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. District heating systems have proven to supply heat for buildings both energy and cost efficiently. Thermal microgrids (TMGs) can be understood as a subcategory of district heating systems: small scale, bidirectional, and potentially fed by different thermal sources. Given a suitable combination of loads, the number of and distance between buildings, they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on georeferenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient TMG. For the identification, both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify nine groups of 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17.4\% cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply. This would save approximately 30\% of the building-induced CO2 emission of the community.},

Many statistic and data-mining technologies have been applied to develop a reliable occupant model. In contrast, rather than attempting to develop the occupant model, this study aims to investigate the correlation between the occupant behavior and energy consumption based on a series of experiments. First, this paper discusses the randomness of the occupants’ presence and behavior. The degree of randomness was verified using a Normalized Cumulative Periodogram (NCP) based on a random walk hypothesis. In addition, the correlation between occupant and energy consumption was investigated using the wavelet coherence. This study shows that, while the occupants’ presence has a randomness, it is not strongly correlated to the energy consumption. The occupants’ active action to control a heating/cooling system (turn on/off) is correlated to the energy consumption. In contrast to the occupant's presence, the occupants’ active action does not follow the random walk, and it has no particular frequency. This means that it is difficult to predict the control action of occupants with a specific time interval.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency (EE) and demand response (DR) programs are designed to reduce energy consumption, mitigate grid capacity constraints, support intermittent renewable energy integration, and reduce pollution for less than the cost of additional generation. However, the savings and flexibility achieved by EE and DR programs are contingent on programs finding and enrolling customers well matched to program objectives. Many EE programs currently rely on broad but shallow savings from prescriptive measures, but growing in- terest in deeper and more reliable savings is leading to increased attention for program planning and targeting using empirical criteria. Through data gathered by smart meters and software designed to manage and analyze large data sets, the tools required to cost effectively characterize, target, and change patterns of energy demand are beginning to emerge. This dissertation consists of three chapters on the analysis of meter data and one on the policy implications of these new capabilities.
Chapter 2 analyzes hourly electricity and daily natural gas smart meter readings from 30,000 residential customers of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E).

This dissertation consists of three chapters on the analysis of meter data and one on the policy implications of these new capabilities.
Chapter 2 analyzes hourly electricity and daily natural gas smart meter readings from 30,000 residential customers of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E). Meter data is used to derive distributions of previously unobserved characteristics of the housing stock. We show that the targeting of EE and DR programs would be improved through selection of households based on their positions within these distributions. It follows that every utility (or public utility commission) with sufficient metering infrastructure could ap- ply similar techniques to improve the targeting, implementation, and evaluation of their energy efficiency and demand response programs.
Chapter 3 uses regression models of patterns in daily household electricity consumption to estimate the physical and operational characteristics of homes. We apply semi-physical regressors designed to capture patterns in the space-heating and cooling, scheduling, and occupancy of homes. When applied to data from approximately 160,000 PG\&E customers, this approach supports an evaluation of competing regression model formulations and provides distributions of model coefficients used to evaluate patterns of domestic energy use, including annual and system peak coincident air conditioning loads, cooling set points, day of week scheduling, and lighting energy.






Chapter 4 presents a method for estimating the hourly timing of occupant driven loads based on smart meter data. The residuals of a predictive regression model are assumed to include occupant activities because occupant controlled energy use is not fully determined by externally observable factors. Occupant activity timing is converted into empirical distributions of the probability of such events by hour-of-day or day-of-week. With estimates calculated for approximately 25,000 PG\&E customers and grouped using K-means clustering, prevailing patterns are interpreted as the result of occupant lifestyles — with applications in efficiency and demand response program targeting.

We propose a new framework for multi-rate, large scale data management and analysis, which is able to comprise raw voltage and current data handling at 25 kHz, feature data with a temporal resolution of one second and 10 minutes smart meter data altogether. The introduced high rate power grid data acquisition devices are securely coupled to a big data management system for long term data storage, which forms the data basis for the development of new analysis and simulation methods. The Hadoop based time series analysis is performed locally on the data storage cluster and enables the detection of significant events as voltage sags in large time series.

	abstract = {There is an increasing need for automated fault detection tools in buildings. The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach.},

Specifically, lighting, plug loads, HVAC equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10 min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules. The identified occupancy rules and schedules are representative as four archetypal working profiles that can be used as input to current building energy modeling programs, such as EnergyPlus or IDA-ICE, to investigate impact of occupant presence on design, operation and energy use in office buildings.},

However, HMPC requires a more complex IT infrastructure and numerical optimization in the loop, which makes commissioning, operation of the building, and error handling significantly more involved than in the rule based setting. In this paper, we suggest an automated RBC synthesis procedure for binary decisions that extracts prevalent information from simulation data with HMPC controllers. The result is a set of simple decision rules that preserves much of the control performance of HMPC. The methods are based on standard machine learning algorithms, in particular support vector machines (SVMs) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost).

A set of several features are extracted from the Almanac of Minutely Power Dataset, and a suboptimal selection is executed to determinate the best combination.

A total of 10 background models are created, by employing both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) under a comparative perspective, and each of them is adopted to detect 10 leakages, with random duration, length and starting time. Finally, the performance are evaluated in terms of Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). Obtained results are more than encouraging: the best average AUCs of 85.60\% and 87.97\% are achieved with HMM, at 1 minute resolution, for natural gas and water, respectively. Specifically, considering true detection rates (TDRs) of 100\%, the natural gas exhibits an overall false detection rate (FDR) of 17.11\%, and the water achieves an overall FDR of 13.79\%.},

	abstract = {With the advances of information technologies, today's Building Automation Systems (BASs) are capable of managing building operational performance in an efficient and convenient way. Meanwhile, the amount of real-time monitoring and control data in BASs grows continually in the building lifecycle, which stimulates an intense demand for powerful big data analysis tools in BASs. Existing big data analytics adopted in the building automation industry focus on mining cross-sectional relationships, whereas the temporal relationships, i.e., the relationships over time, are usually overlooked. However, building operations are typically dynamic and BAS data are essentially multivariate time series data. This paper presents a time series data mining methodology for temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data. A number of time series data mining techniques are explored and carefully assembled, including the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif discovery, and temporal association rule mining. This study also develops two methods for the efficient post-processing of knowledge discovered. The methodology has been applied to analyze the BAS data retrieved from a real building. The temporal knowledge discovered is valuable to identify dynamics, patterns and anomalies in building operations, derive temporal association rules within and between subsystems, assess building system performance and spot opportunities in energy conservation.},

	abstract = {Building Automation System (BAS) plays an important role in building operation nowadays. A huge amount of building operational data is stored in BAS; however, the data can seldom be effectively utilized due to the lack of powerful tools for analyzing the large data. Data mining (DM) is a promising technology for discovering knowledge hidden in large data. This paper presents a generic framework for knowledge discovery in massive BAS data using DM techniques. The framework is specifically designed considering the low quality and complexity of BAS data, the diversity of advanced DM techniques, as well as the integration of knowledge discovered by DM techniques and domain knowledge in the building field. The framework mainly consists of four phases, i.e., data exploration, data partitioning, knowledge discovery, and post-mining. The framework is applied to analyze the BAS data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is adopted to identify the most significant time variables to the aggregated power consumption. Then the clustering analysis is used to identify the typical operation patterns in terms of power consumption. Eight operation patterns have been identified and therefore the entire BAS data are partitioned into eight subsets. The quantitative association rule mining (QARM) method is adopted for knowledge discovery in each subset considering most of BAS data are numeric type. To enhance the efficiency of the post-mining phase, two indices are proposed for fast and conveniently identifying and utilizing potentially interesting rules discovered by QARM. The knowledge discovered is successfully used for understanding the building operating behaviors, identifying non-typical operating conditions and detecting faulty conditions.},

However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation. We have applied these methods to two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production. The results provide important new insights into the recurring patterns.},

The regression models (RMs) can be considerably improved by introducing the rate of change of the indoor air temperature (DTind) as an independent variable. Thus, R2 values were raised by up to 0.5 (e.g. from 0.2 to 0.7, example with the lowest R2). A new training and application process for the RMs revealed further improvements by using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to determine different day-types as additional (categorical) variables in the RM. The application of these improved RMs for outlier detection is demonstrated in three buildings.

Contrary to conventional approaches to profiling electricity loads, this study proposes a new clustering technique based on variability indices that collectively represent the potential demand–response resource that these customers would supply. Our analysis reveals that variability in pre-enrollment load patterns does indeed have great predictive power for estimating their impact on demand–response loads. Customers in relatively low-variability clusters provided limited or no response, whereas customers in relatively high-variability clusters consistently presented large load impacts, accounting for most of the program-level peak reductions. This study suggests that dynamic pricing programs themselves may not offer adequate motivation for meaningful adjustments in load patterns, particularly for customers in low-variability clusters.},

Most data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters. Two main dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following. First, incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns. Second, a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist, or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns. This is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process.

The overarching goal of this research is to identify the optimal methods for visualizing building performance information in commercial buildings. The current phase consists of three research activities: (1) product reviews of building visualization software products; (2) a study of expert users regarding attitudes and practices regarding visualization of energy and other building metrics; and (3) a survey of workplace occupants to understand how they use building energy information, and whether improved access to this information will encourage energy conservation behaviors in the workplace.

	abstract = {In the past several decades Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) have become vital components of most modern buildings. BEMSs utilize advanced microprocessor technology combined with extensive sensor data collection and communication to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high human comfort levels. When properly tuned and operated, BEMSs can provide significant energy savings. However, the complexity of the acquired sensory data and the overwhelming amount of presented information renders them difficult to adjust or even understand by responsible building managers. This inevitably results in suboptimal BEMS operation and performance. To address this issue, this paper reports on a research effort that utilizes Computational Intelligence techniques to fuse multiple heterogeneous sources of BEMS data and to extract relevant actionable information. This actionable information can then be easily understood and acted upon by responsible building managers. In particular, this paper describes the use of anomaly detection algorithms for improving the understandability of BEMS data and for increasing the state-awareness of building managers. The developed system utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to automatically build a model of normal BEMS operations and detect possible anomalous behavior. In addition, linguistic summaries based on fuzzy set representation of the input values are generated for the detected anomalies which increase the understandability of the presented results.

Automatically discovering the structure of diurnal patterns in this data supports implementation of building commissioning, fault detection and retrofit analysis techniques.

In this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using k-means clustering. This procedure is designed for application on whole building and sub-system metrics from hierarchical building and energy management systems (BMS/EMS). The process transforms quantitative raw data into qualitative subgroups based on daily performance similarity and visualizes them using expressive techniques. We apply DayFilter on 474 days of example data from an international school campus in a tropical climate and 407 days of data from an office building from a temperate European climate. Discords are filtered resulting in 17 and 22 patterns found. Selected discords are investigated and many correlate with specific failures and energy savings detected by the on-site operations staff. Six and ten motif candidates are detected in the two case studies. These motifs are then further aggregated to five and six performance clusters that reflect the typical operational behavior of those projects. We discuss the influence of the parameter choices and provide initial parameter settings for the DayFilter process.},

In this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using k-means clustering.

This chapter has two mains goals and, consequently, is divided in two parts. In the first part, the goal is to present a brief overview on how data mining techniques have been used in power systems. There are several works, such as (Mori, 2002), that introduce data mining techniques to people with background in power systems. In contrast, this text assumes previous knowledge of data mining, describes some fundamental concepts of power systems and illustrates the kind of problems that the electric industry tries to solve with data mining.

The information from the electricity bills of an institution such as the University of Leo ́n, with several billing points, constitutes a high-dimensional data set which is quite complicated to visualize at a glance. The use of techniques for dimensionality reduction enables to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the original data set which highlights main features in data and is easier to visualize.

	abstract = {Motivation: Data centers are a critical component of modern IT infrastructure but are also among the worst environmental offenders through their increasing energy usage and the resulting large carbon footprints. Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a 'first-principles' approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable. Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse "don't care" transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by HP and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach.},

These infrastructures are poorly understood due to the lack of “first principles” models of chiller systems. At the same time, they abound in data due to instrumentation by modern sensor networks. We present a multi-level framework to transduce sensor streams into an actionable dynamic Bayesian network model of the system. This network is then used to explain observed system transitions and aid in diagnostics and prediction. We showcase experimental results using a HP data center in Bangalore, India.

The study covers analyses of both simulated and actual data. The simulated data of lighting power density (LPD) is generated from Gaussian distributions for 36 cases with different means, variances, and mixing proportions for the investigation. For actual data analysis, LPD values of commercial buildings are extracted from an energy audit database. It is found that the clustering technique yields more accurate energy saving estimation of the actual values (0–11\% error) than that computed by the general approach (1–100\% error). The proposed clustering method can therefore be used to estimate the potential energy savings for lighting systems in buildings with high accuracy.

The main advantages of the data-based approach are that customer location is noticed, comparison groups are created using concrete building information, data processing is highly automated and also method is computationally efficient. Additionally, presented method provide tool to target and to create customer specific electric- ity saving guidance. The performance of suggested approach was tested using data set which contained electricity use and building information concerning almost 8000 customers.

Though these analysis skills can be learnt over several years by some (while some never learn it well enough to be comfortable even after several years of practice), what is needed is a textbook which provides:


A review of classical statistics and probability concepts,


A basic and unified perspective of the various techniques of data based mathematical modeling and analysis,


an understanding of the “process” along with the tools,


a proper combination of classical methods with the more recent machine learning and auto-
mated tools which the wide spread use of computers has spawned, and

By only transmitting a message when a known motif is encountered in the sensor data, PowerSAX can significantly reduce an application’s bandwidth requirements.

	abstract = {The building stock in the world consumes approximately 40\% of the energy and emits one third of the total greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). Improving the energy efficiency in buildings is vital to address the climate change and achieve energy independence (i.e. to become net-zero energy). Improving energy performance in existing buildings has been receiving significant attention recently, which entails reducing energy demand for building operations, without affecting the health and comfort of its occupants. This approach requires strategies beyond mere technical advancements. However, there is limited published literature which has comprehensively addressed these issues.

The aim of this paper is to critically review existing body-of-the-knowledge on improving energy efficiency of operating both commercial and institutional buildings. Peer-reviewed journal articles published from year 2000 to 2014 in reputed journals were reviewed. This review investigated contemporary energy efficiency approaches including technical, organizational, and behavioural changes. Based on the comprehensive literature review, a strategy map was developed as a pathway for achieving better building energy performance. It was noted that even though the existing studies predominately focused on technical advancements, approaches such as building behavioural changes have been largely overlooked. Findings of this study provide an important basis for setting up a national and organization wide strategy for improving the energy efficiency of commercial and institutional buildings.},

A three-step procedure is proposed in this paper that begins by considering the local building and heating system regulations as well as the specific features of the climate zone. Firstly, the dynamic thermal performance of different variables is specifi- cally modelled, for each building type and climate zone. Secondly, Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning is used to extract the relevant features. Finally, neural projections and identification techniques are applied, in order to detect fluctuations in room temperatures and, in consequence, thermal insula- tion failures.

This paper describes a pattern recognition algorithm for determining days of the week with similar energy consumption profiles. The algorithm determines energy use features, such as average daily consumption or peak daily consumption, from time series of energy use. Features are transformed to remove the effects of seasonal variation that may be present in time series data. Then, the transformed features are grouped by day of the week into seven clusters. Univariate and multivariate outlier analysis methods are used to remove unusual data from the seven clusters. Finally, a modified agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm determines days of the week with similar energy consumption profiles

Any forecast errors will result in either reliability issues or increased costs for the company. Because of the widespread roll-out of smart meters, a large amount of high resolution consumption data is now accessible which was not available in the past. This new data can be used to improve the load forecast and as a result increase the reliability and decrease the expenses of electricity providers. In this paper, a number of methods for improving load forecast using smart meter data are discussed. In these methods, consumers are first divided into a number of clusters. Then a neural network is trained for each cluster and forecasts of these networks are added together in order to form the prediction for the aggregated load. In this paper, it is demonstrated that clustering increases the forecast accuracy significantly. Criteria used for grouping consumers play an important role in this process. In this work, three different feature selection methods for clustering consumers are explained and the effect of feature extraction methods on forecast error is investigated.},

With the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), low-cost and self-organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems, but produce abundant sensing data. Therefore, a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of WSANs based smart building systems. However, traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data, which are not suitable for large scale WSANs based smart building systems. To address these issues, we build an efficient rule engine. Specifically, we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages, and then build a β-network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events. Taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of MPHF, we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with O(1) time overhead. Moreover, a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead. We implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set.},

This paper presents a strategy for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of HVAC systems involving sensor faults at the system level. Two schemes are involved in the system-level FDD strategy, i.e. system FDD scheme and sensor fault detection, diagnosis and estimation (FDD\&E) scheme. In the system FDD scheme, one or more performance indices (PIs) are introduced to indicate the performance status (normal or faulty) of each system. Regression models are used as the benchmarks to validate the PIs computed from the actual measurements. The reliability of the system FDD is affected by the health of sensor measurements. A method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used to detect and diagnose the sensor bias and to correct the sensor bias prior to the use of the system FDD scheme.

	abstract = {Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) are essential components of modern buildings that are responsible for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. However, since indoor environment is dependent on many uncertain criteria, performance of BEMS can be suboptimal at times. Unfortunately, complexity of BEMSs, large amount of data, and interrelations between data can make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. This paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Anomaly Detection and Linguistic Description (Fuzzy-ADLD)-based method for improving the understandability of BEMS behavior for improved state-awareness. The presented method is composed of two main parts: 1) detection of anomalous BEMS behavior; and 2) linguistic representation of BEMS behavior. The first part utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to build a model of normal BEMS behavior. The second part of the presented method computes the most relevant linguistic description of the identified anomalies. The presented Fuzzy-ADLD method was applied to real-world BEMS system and compared against a traditional alarm-based BEMS. Six different scenarios were tested, and the presented Fuzzy-ADLD method identified anomalous behavior either as fast as or faster (an hour or more) than the alarm based BEMS. Furthermore, the Fuzzy-ADLD method identified cases that were missed by the alarm-based system, thus demonstrating potential for increased state-awareness of abnormal building behavior.},

This paper presents and demonstrates a method to quickly identify when regular periodic activities, such as a daily night setback on a thermostat, are inappropriately configured or accidentally reset. Anomalies in periodic building operations are identified by analyzing smart meter electrical demand data in the frequency domain with a weekly travelling time window instead of using time domain functions such as load factor.

This study investigates the use of DM for analyzing the large data sets in BAS with the aim of improving building operational performance. An applicable framework for mining BAS database is proposed. The framework is implemented to mine the BAS database of the tallest building in Hong Kong. After data preparation, clustering analysis is performed to identify the typical power consumption patterns of the building. Then, association rule mining is adopted to unveil the associations among power consumptions of major components in each cluster. Lastly, post-mining is conducted to interpret the rules.

This paper first conducts a comprehensive review of the commonly used data analysis methods applied to building-related data. Both the strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed. Then, the critical analysis of the previous solutions to three fundamental problems of building energy performance improvement that remain significant barriers is performed. Considering the limitations of those commonly used data analysis methods, data mining techniques are proposed as a primary tool to analyze building-related data. Moreover, a data analysis process and a data mining framework are proposed that enable building-related data to be analyzed more efficiently. The process refers to a series of sequential steps in analyzing data. The framework includes different data mining techniques and algorithms, from which a set of efficient data analysis methodologies can be developed.

A five-stage process model of load classification is constructed based on the summary and analysis of studies about load classification in smart grid environment. Then, the commonly used clustering methods for load classification are summarized and briefly reviewed, and the well-known evaluation methods for load classification are also introduced. Besides, the applications of load classification, including bad data identification and correction, load forecasting and tariff setting, are discussed.
